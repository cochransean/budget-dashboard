# budget-dashboard
A D3-based prototype of a dashboard allowing decision-makers to evaluate budget trade-offs based on organizational priorities.

If we were a fictional government agency in a disaster-prone universe, how would we align our limited budget against the many pressing threats: zombies, aliens, and mutant super-villains?  Here is one possible solution.

Fictional data shows how military and political leaders might evaluate budget decisions to prepare for potential conflicts against a diverse array of actors, each requiring unique capabilities.  Sliders allow leaders to "dial in" weights to each actor.  The visualization is updated based on these weights, producing a crowd-sourced, expert-consensus budget recommendation.

A similar dashboard could be used to inform real-world organizational trade-offs, drawing upon expert opinion and the "wisdom of crowds" to allow decision makers to explore options in a more rigorous and quantitatively-informed way.

Note: The data depicted is for demonstration purposes only: it does not reflect actual budgets or organizational priorities for the US government or any other entity.
